## Introduction

Well this is a breath of fresh air! I didn't expect to find myself putting together a zine at midnight last Wednesday, but fate seemingly led me there. I was talking with some folks over Discord while working my day job, when we got onto the subject of making zines. [Em Zullo](http://emilyzullo.art/) in particular suggested putting together a photography zine, which was enough of a push to occupy me for the rest of the day and on into the wee hours of the night.

Before I jump into the process, I wanted to quickly touch on what a zine actually is (when I was initially telling some of my friends about this little project, I got quite a few blank stares). For lack of a robust explanation, a zine is a homemade magazine. However, the definition of "magazine" here is very loose; zines are made with many different types of materials, are bound in many different ways, and come in all different shapes and sizes! Historically, zines have been a medium for conveying counter-cultural messages and for uplifting oppressed and under-represented voices. However, a zine doesn't have to fall into that bucket to be considered a zine; folks nowadays have taken to making zines about their hobbies, everyday lives, and much more! There are even entire zine fests dedicated to selling and trading zines. There's a very rich history behind the production and distribution of zines, and I'd highly recommend reading up on it (you can start at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zine)!).

## Where Do I Start?

That was my first thought when I decided to dedicate some time to this. I knew that I wanted to make the zine about the American South and industry, a topic I had explored in a recent final project for a photography class. However, how to make that a physical thing was a bit foreign. So, I started thinking about some of the work I'd seen my friend [Lu Horrorhare](https://www.horrorhare.com/) do to prepare his comic *Penske Chronicles* (it's not out yet so I can't link to anything, go to his Twitter and pummel him with rocks until he releases it). I suppose I sort of worked backwards from what he was doing; in his case, he created each page of the comic first with a rough idea of layout, then went through layout hell once all the pages were finalized. To quote him: "its weird bc i both was thinking and also not thinking".

Unlike Lu, I like to think[^1]. So, I wanted to pre-plan the zine layout so I could build it with a final design in mind. I made a little mental list of things that I knew I wanted the zine to be:

* **Topic**: Photography of industry and byproducts in the American South
* **Format**: Opens and reads similar to a standard magazine; saddle stitched (stapled)
* **Size**: All pages to be cut from a single piece of US letter paper (8.5" x 11"), I wanted to [keep it simple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) and not have to deal with multiple pages
* **Orientation**: Vertical; I don't have a [saddle stitch stapler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddle_stitch_stapler) and the furthest my current stapler can reach is ~3 inches

## Prototyping

With the basic attributes in mind, it was time to make some prototypes! I watched a couple videos on zine making and looked around for some templates ([Wuthipol Ujathammarat](https://www.wuthipoldesigns.com/) has made some great examples!), and noticed most were for folded zines where all the pages are connected. However, since I wanted a saddle stitch stapled zine, the page numbers in those templates weren't where I needed them to be. So, I grabbed a piece of paper and cut it down into fourths, then folded each one vertically to make it a page spread. I stapled all the spreads together in the middle, then labeled each page accordingly, before taking it back apart to re-assemble it as a single page. What I was left with was a template that I could then reference to make a digital template, which would be easy to work from.

After a long while of fiddling with Photoshop's guides, I was able to put together a template that would allow me to create a double-sided PDF for printing, where each page would be aligned. To help me choose how to sequence the photos, I also marked which pages are left and right (in hindsight, I could've just looked at evens vs. odds, but I'm forgetful so this helped me). I did a quick test print, cut it down, and stapled it to double-check that everything lined up well and that no pages were out of order. Luckily, I got it on the first try!

You can grab the template here if you want to try it for yourself: [ZineLayout_2-3RatioPhotos.zip](ZineLayout_2-3RatioPhotos.zip) (heads up that it extracts to ~256 MB since the canvas is large). I specifically designed the template for 2:3 aspect ratio photos since that's what I typically shoot, but you can adjust the magenta guides to accommodate for a different aspect ratio. If you print using this template, flip along the short side and keep in mind that this is made for US letter paper.

## Okay, Make the Thing Already

Alright, so I had a nice template to work from, I knew that my pages would line up when printed, now I just needed to make the thing! I started by laying out the candidate photos that I might want to include in the zine. I originally planned to pull from selections for my photography class final project, but I ended up pulling a lot more photos from after I graduated. While looking through everything, I found the artist's statement I wrote for the final project, which I tidied up and incorporated into the zine to help drive the narrative. In fact, writing in the text came before placing any photos into the project; I've found that having a concept fresh in my mind helps to drive me towards stronger creative decisions!

One downside of designing the zine like this was while I knew what pages on the sheet would physically go next to one another, I couldn't directly see the sequencing outside of some careful spacial reasoning (quick! rotate an apple in your mind!). However, it eased a lot of the pain that would have come along with figuring out the layout later, so I think it was worth it. I'll likely print some little thumbnail photos that I can cut up and physically position next time, though!

Now that I actually had everything laid out, I exported the two different sides of the sheets as PDFs, combined them, and made a test print at home. I have an older inkjet printer and some plain white paper stock that I normally use to print documents, so I figured I would give it a try. I definitely was not satisfied with the results; there was lots of ink bleeding since the paper was relatively thin, alongside bad color reproduction and DPI. With this in mind, I decided to get a small batch made from Office Depot, since they offered solid printing and a quick turnaround. I got 15 sheets printed, and used up 2 making some final prototypes.

The reason I needed to make these "final" prototypes was because the printing didn't actually go as expected; it seems like Office Depot enforces a margin on document prints, so there was a slight white border that caused everything to need to be trimmed, re-adjusted, stapled, then re-trimmed in order to align all the pages properly. This extended the time to produce a zine much longer than I initially expected, considering I thought I would only be making 3 cuts and then stapling. However, I'm still very happy with the end result, and got 13 good copies out of it!

If you're curious and would like to order a either a physical or digital copy, they are available now over at my [Ko-fi shop](https://ko-fi.com/resistiv/shop)! Buying a copy helps me to be able to make more zines and cool printed stuff in the future; I've already got some neat ideas of what I want to do next!! Hope you enjoyed reading this article and learning a little on how it was made, and I hope you make a zine about something in your life too, it's a lot of fun!!

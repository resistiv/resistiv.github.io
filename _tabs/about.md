Hiya, I'm Kai (they/them)!

I'm a Computer Science student studying at the University of Alabama, working towards my bachelor's and master's degrees concurrently. I enjoy working with the C family of languages, with C# being my favorite. When I'm not working on uni assignments, I'm practicing reverse engineering by working on old video games (particularly PS1 games). I also enjoy documenting the proprietary file formats that said old games use and writing tools for the particularly interesting ones.

Aside from software development, I am a casual voice actor, photographer, coin collector, archivist, genealogist, and so much more (can you tell I get hooked on things easily?). The overarching theme encompassing a lot of my interests is a desire to capture & document things that are obscure, forgotten, or otherwise lost.

You can find me elsewhere online at the links at the bottom of the sidebar. If you don't see a link you're looking for, try looking for me as ``resistiv`` or ``ResistivKai`` on your site of choice.

If you ever need anything, don't be afraid to reach out, I promise I don't bite! You can most quickly reach me over on Twitter or via email and I'll try my best to get back to you as soon as possible.

My favicon was created by [@kingjaspy](https://twitter.com/kingjaspy) and my icon was created by [@pillowdinos](https://twitter.com/pillowdinos), both over on Twitter!

\- Kai :)
